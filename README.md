# transmission-rule-out
Estimating the power of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data to rule-out transmission events.

The greater diversity of the virus circulating in a community, the more likely it is that cases with coincidental epidemiological links will have a large genetic distance, ruling out transmission.

In a sample from San Diego, CA, from August 2021, more than 99% of pairs of viruses are more than 2 SNPs apart.

Thanks to @gkarthik for adding code to mask known problematic sites in the alignment. (NB: the original analysis was run on 2429 sequences; the notebook has been updated to 3830 sequences after more were deposited to GISAID.)
